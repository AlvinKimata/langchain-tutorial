    "## Part 3: Adding Memory to the Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Our chatbot can now use tools to answer user questions, but it doesn't remember the context of previous interactions. This limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph solves this problem through **persistent checkpointing**. If you provide a `checkpointer` when compiling the graph and a `thread_id` when calling your graph, LangGraph automatically saves the state after each step. When you invoke the graph again using the same `thread_id`, the graph loads its saved state, allowing the chatbot to pick up where it left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see later that **checkpointing** is much more powerful than simple chat memory - _it lets you save and resume complex state at any time for error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel interactions, and more_. But before we get too ahead of ourselves, let's add checkpointing to enable multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, create a `SqliteSaver` checkpointer."

    "Notice that we've specified `:memory` as the Sqlite DB path. This is convenient for our tutorial **(it saves it all in-memory)**. In a production application, you would likely change this to connect to your own DB and/or use one of the other checkpointer classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next define the graph. Now that you've already built your own `BasicToolNode`, we'll replace it with LangGraph's prebuilt `ToolNode` and `tools_condition`, since these do some nice things like parallel API execution. Apart from that, the following is all copied from Part 2."
